# Binary Tree Traversal Practice Tool

This project is an interactive Python program designed to help users practice binary tree traversals, including preorder, inorder, and postorder. The program generates a random binary tree of a user-defined size, visualizes it in a 2D grid format, and challenges users to input the correct traversal sequence for a selected order. 

## Key Features:
- **Random Tree Generation**: A binary tree of random structure is generated based on the user’s size input.
- **2D Tree Visualization**: The tree is displayed in a 2D format, providing a clear visual guide.
- **Traversal Types**: Users can choose between preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal modes.
- **Interactive Input**: The program compares the user’s traversal input with the correct sequence and provides feedback on accuracy.
- **Educational Utility**: This tool is perfect for students or anyone looking to reinforce their understanding of tree traversal algorithms.

## How to Use:
1. Run the program and select a tree size.
2. Choose a traversal order (preorder, inorder, postorder).
3. Input the correct sequence of node values based on the tree structure.
4. Get immediate feedback on the accuracy of your traversal.
