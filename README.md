# binary_iterating_practice
This project is an interactive Python program designed to help users practice binary tree traversals, including preorder, inorder, and postorder. The program generates a random binary tree of a user-defined size, visualizes it in a 2D grid format, and challenges users to input the correct traversal sequence for a selected order.
